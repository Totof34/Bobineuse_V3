Here the function than my program include and which seems to me appropriate

 1° automatic counting and uncounting
 2° counting from zero or down from a specified number of turns
 3° initial point or initial carcass start recordable and reminder 
 4° guide wire enslaved on the up / down counting
 5° automatic reversing guide wire depending on the number of turns per layer and change side
 6° manual correction of errors in advance of the guide wire, losses step essentially
 7° Manual correction of counting errors
 8° management parameters by a "management" menu and a second separate part for the counting itself
 9° recordings of 10 different configurations to facilitate the winding of several transformers,
    by recording the primary and secondary sections separately and recall stored data in memory
10° display menus on 16x2 characters LCD

Of course my Leonardo's board also allows PC control if you wanted to, but I prefer a
standalone machine
